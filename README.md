In my former life as a teacher, I worked in a variety of different type of schools 
and school buildings, some of which had dedicated library spaces, and others that did not. 
Classroom libraries can operate as a supplement to or in place of a centralized library
space for a school -- getting books closer to the students who want to read them, but 
also making it more difficult for teachers and students to know the full range of books 
truly available to students within the school building at a given time.

Developed as a personal project while completing training in backend development, 
Classroom-librarian is a book inventory management system designed for schools to
get the most out of their classroom libraries by helping teachers and students
keep track of their book collection across multiple classrooms in a school building. 

This project will be built in phases, for a more detailed view of the project design 
and current phase, please check out the [DESIGN_DOCUMENT](DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md).
